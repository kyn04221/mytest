    <h1>HTML</h1>
    Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> 
   pages</strong> and web applications.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
   into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included 
   cues for the appearance of the document.
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects 
   such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create 
   structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, 
   quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets
